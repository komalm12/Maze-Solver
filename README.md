# Maze Solver Application

## Overview
The Maze Solver is a web-based application designed to upload a maze image and visualize its solution dynamically. This project integrates the concept of "Convergence," emphasizing the collaboration between disciplines such as computer vision, artificial intelligence, and web development to create an innovative solution.

## Features
- **Maze Image Upload**: Upload any maze image in `.jpg`, `.png`, or other supported formats.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Displays the solved maze as an animated GIF.
- **Stylish Interface**: Modern design with glassmorphism, neon effects, and responsive layout.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Maze Compatibility**: Works only for rectangular and square mazes.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web interface.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including animations, glassmorphism, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features and dynamic content handling.

### Backend (Optional):
- **Python (Flask/Django)**: For processing the maze image and generating the solution (if implemented).
- **AI/ML Algorithms**: For maze-solving logic (if applicable).



## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/maze-solver.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd maze-solver
  
3. Run Command: python -m venv venv to create virtual environment

   then activate the virtual Environment by venv/Scripts/activate

   then run Python app.py On terminal
 
5. Upload a maze image and click "Solve Maze" to view the solution.

## Design Highlights
### Theme: Convergence
The design reflects the theme of **Convergence**, symbolizing the intersection of disciplines and technologies:
- **Background**: A gradient background inspired by collaboration and unity.
- **Glassmorphism**: Represents transparency and the blending of ideas.
- **Neon Effects**: Adds a futuristic touch to emphasize innovation.
- **Dynamic Elements**: Animations for seamless and engaging user interaction.

## Future Enhancements
- **Backend Integration**: Implement AI algorithms to process and solve the maze in real-time.
- **Enhanced Animations**: Provide step-by-step visualization of the maze-solving process.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to save and share their results.
- **Support for Larger Mazes**: Optimize for high-resolution images.
